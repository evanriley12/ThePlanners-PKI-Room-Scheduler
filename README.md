# PKI Room Scheduler

UNO - Spring 2024 CS Capstone Project

Our application is a tool to manage and reschedule classroom assignments for PKI.

# Release Notes:
- Connected front and backend (React and Springboot).
- Implemented a basic frontend to represent what the application will look like with the general layout based on our wireframe.
- Implemented a file upload button that reads in a csv and displays contents, this was originally planned to be stored as an object, but for now it just displays the text. Parsing and storing data will be implemented once work on the algorithm begins.

Our Integration branch has most of our content, but has not been pushed to main since we are dealing with some issues running on the server.
