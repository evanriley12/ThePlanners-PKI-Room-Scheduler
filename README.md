# PKI Room Scheduler

UNO - Spring 2024 CS Capstone Project

Our application is a tool to manage and reschedule classroom assignments for PKI.

# Release Notes:
- Polished the frontend for a smoother and more aesthetically pleasing experience.
- The user is now notified when an upload of the csv succeeds or fails.
- The application now parses data from the uploaded csv for use in the backend (can also be seen in the dropdown menu).
- Implemented a very basic algorithm that displays other classrooms that could fit a selected course.
    - Due to some issues with the dropdown box, this is always showing the algorithm being executed on the first class in the list with a new enrollment of 50.
- Lots of backend work to prepare for more in-depth algorithm development.
- Added basic tests to handle uploading and parsing the csv file.

Our Integration branch has our most updated version.
