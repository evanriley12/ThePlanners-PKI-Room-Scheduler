# PKI Room Scheduler

UNO - Spring 2024 CS Capstone Project

Our application is a tool to manage and reschedule classroom assignments for PKI.

# Milestone 4 Release Notes:
- New Features:
    - The Algorithm now outputs a Result object that is easier to work with on the backend, and also results in some more detailed information in the output.
    - Error handling added in a few rare cases where classes cannot be rescheduled.
    - The algorithm output display has been revamped to allow for multiple results to be displayed at once.
    - The algorithm output display window is now scrollable to allow the user to stack as many outputs as needed.
    - Added a download results button that outputs a text file containing all information in the result field to allow for a way to save results.
    - Online courses no longer display in the course selection box, since they don't have a classroom to begin with.
    - Added Javadocs via Doxygen to give information about all of our classes.
    - Various visual changes to the frontend to add more polish.
    - Various general bug fixes.

Our Main branch has our most updated version.
