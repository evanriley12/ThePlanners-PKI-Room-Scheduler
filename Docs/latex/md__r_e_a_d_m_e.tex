\item New Features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The class information box now shows the class information for the section selected from the dropdown menu.
\item The Max Class Size and Enrollment input fields now automatically populate based on the selected section.
\item The Max Class Size and Enrollment input fields can now properly be incremented and decremented using the arrows in each box.
\item The Scheduling algorithm now actually works\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Determines the relationship between all classes to determine which have overlapping times.
\item Only considers rooms that are open during the time of the class.
\item Displays the best choice to move the room to, based on which available classroom has the smallest number of seats that still accomodate the change.
\item Also displays the other classrooms that would work just as well, as well as the options that work worse.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item Added a UNO icon to the tab display rather than using React\textquotesingle{}s default.
\item Font and text size changes to make information more readable.
